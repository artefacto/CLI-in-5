Ok, almost there now! You made it to lesson 5.

Let's install some new educational software that we can make available in our library.

There's a list of educational software that's available in the debian repository, though not all of it has been ported to the Raspberry Pi.


https://packages.debian.org/stable/education/

Let's install gcompris, an educational software package for children.

apt-get install gcompris

Others you might like to try:

junior-education
(Debian Jr. education applications)

rurple-ng
A package for learn programming in Python with a robot

Try it, just use apt-get followed by the package name. (as listed above)
