Lesson 4

So now in this lesson we're going to install some software from the command line.

In linux systems, software is often installed using a 'package manager'.

The first thing we'll do is to make sure everything else is up-to-date. WE can do this with the following commands.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

We can also use apt-get to install new software

sudo apt-get install bsdgame

What is apt-get?

The 'apt' part of this command refers to the Advanced Package Tool (APT), the library of software applications used by Debian. Apt-get is a utility to install packages from this library.

In Raspbian, the package manager is apt-get.

Sudo refers to the superuser, or root user of the machine. This might prompt you for your password. It's to make sure you have permission to install new software.
