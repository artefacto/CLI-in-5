Welcome to lesson 2!

In this lesson, we're going to do a bit of tidying up.

Now that we have a new directory to play with, let's move one of our files.

We can do this using the move command - mv

Let's crete a new file and move it into our sandbox folder.

touch myNewFile.txt

mv myNewFile.txt cli-sandbox/myNewFile.txt

To check it's there ok, you can again use the cd (change directory) and list (ls) commands

Or you combine them like this

ls cli-sandbox.

Great, now make sure you're in the main CLI-in-5 directory and you can start the next lesson with:

cat lesson3
